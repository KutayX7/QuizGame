# QuizGame
This was for an university C++ project.
We got the best score of 99 out of 100 with this project.

As there won't be any further changes, it has been archived.

If you're interested in trying it out, use it with caution. This thing is neither well tested nor uses best practices so it might do weird things.

It has been made to work on Windows, and probably won't work properly on linux.
(This is mostly due to line endings and our unawareness at the time of making this project.)

## The Quiz Game.
The Quiz Game is a console-based game designed to test the player’s knowledge of any concepts. The
game consists of multiple-choice questions with four options, where the player needs to select the correct
answer. There will be a total of 20 questions, and the player needs to answer as many questions as possible
within a limited time frame.


### Gameplay:

+ Upon starting the game, the player will be presented with the first question and four possible answers.
+ The player needs to select the correct answer by entering the corresponding option number (1, 2, 3, or 4) from the console.
+ If the player selects the correct answer, the game will move on to the next question. If the player selects the wrong answer, the game will end.
+ The player will have a total of 10 seconds to answer each question. If the player fails to answer within the time limit, the game will end.
+ After answering all the questions or when the time runs out, the game will display the player’s score, the number of questions answered correctly, and the number of questions answered in-correctly.
